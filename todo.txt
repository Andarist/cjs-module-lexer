Rules:
- module.exports = require(...), require unshadowed
- module.exports = { ... } identifier and string properties supported
- Object.defineProperty(module.exports | exports, string, Object unshadowed
- Object.defineProperties(module.exports, Object unshadowed
- exports.asdf = asdf, unshadowed
- module.exports = asdf, unshadowed
- Top-level managed very carefully... over many statement types
- this only detected at top level not in IIFEs
- if first arg to call is a function, track that for subsequent calls
